<h1 id="history">ModernHistory - The Recovering Future History after Refresh Problem</h1>

<p>
    ModernHistory.js is a javascript library to help single-page application (SPA) authors interact with browser
    history in a useful way. It works by observing programmer and user actions to build an image of all
    accessible states, in the past and the future. When the browser refreshes, history is preserved
    in the browser, but lost in ModernHistory's state, so we have to recover it. This problem is only
    visible when a user builds state, moves back into the middle of the state, and then refreshes the browser.
</p>

<p>
    Recovering <i>future history</i> after a refresh should be a simple problem. One solution, the first
    I tried, was to form a doubly-linked list out of states using <code>nextState</code> and <code>prevState</code>.
    Then we can reach all states from the initial one. When I tried this, the browser literally <i>deleted</i> the
    <code>nextState</code> property of the initial state! So I could access states in the past, but not in the
    future. The user, however, could still click the forward button. The best I could do was fix up <code>timeLine</code>
    with these newly discovered states.
</p>

<p>
    Another way to recover future history after refresh would be to store a reference to the entire timeLine
    which each state. Somehow, again, the browser deleted this property of all states.
</p>

<p>
    Another way, which I attempted but I don't think it really worked, is to store the length of the timeLine,
    infer the length of <i>future history</i> from that, programmatically move forward and stash the states
    into the timeLine. I didn't pursue this because applications, in general, do side-effects on state
    changes and I think it's a bad idea to move around states like this. So I didn't pursue it.

<h2>Steps to Reproduce</h2>

<p>Open the developer console, and watch the output as you click the buttons below!</p>

<ol>
    <li>addState() <button onclick="ModernHistory.addState('a')">a</button> </li>
    <li>addState() <button onclick="ModernHistory.addState('b')">b</button> </li>
    <li>addState() <button onclick="ModernHistory.addState('c')">c</button> </li>
    <li>Pause here to check that <code>ModernHistory.timeLine.length = 3</code>, and
        <code>window.history.state.nextState</code> exists
    </li>
    <li>back() <button onclick="window.history.back()">←</button></li>
    <li>reload() <button onclick="window.location.reload(false)">⟳</button></li>
    <li>Pause here to check that <code>ModernHistory.timeLine.length = 2</code>, and
        <code>window.history.state.nextState</code> does <i><b>not</b></i> exist!
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Observe that <code>ModernHistory.timeLine.length = 2</code>. The expected result is that
    <code>ModernHistory.timeLine.length = 3</code>. If you look more closely, you'll see that
    <code>ModernHistory.state.prevState</code> exists, but <code>ModernHistory.state.nextState</code>
    does not. The expected result is that both properties exist.
