<h1 id="back_button">History and The Back Button</h1>
<p>
    Using the web, you start with a name, the URL. Then in the steady-state, you read the result and click
    on a link, creating the steady-state loop we call "browsing". The browser keeps track of where
    you've been (you're history), and allows you to move back and forth through that history with the
    <i>back</i> and <i>forward</i> buttons. When the browser dumps a page and loads a new one, it's
    called a <code>navigation</code>. A Single Page Application (SPA) doesn't need to move around <i>resources</i>
    like an old-school application, and does no 'navigation' at all! The simplest option is to give up
    the back-button, and at most protect users from making a mistake with the <code>window.onunload</code>
    handler to stop them from leaving a stateful page. If that's not an option then use
    <code>window.pushState()</code> and <code>window.onpopstate</code>, which are powerful footguns!
</p>

<p>
    Let's say your SPA is accessed during a user browsing session. The user accesses R resources,
    then your SPA gets loaded, contributes N new history states, and then the user leaves to go somewhere else.
    In the simplest case the N states only grows. N can shrink if the user <i>invalidates</i> their timeline
    by going back several states, and picking a new path. Those N new states come from a combination
    of <i>anchor link clicks</i>, explicit <code>window.location.hash</code> assignments, and
    explicit <code>pushState()</code> calls. The back-button moves back in the timeline, the forward button
    forward on the timeline.
</p>

<p>
    Hash link:
    <a href="#a">a</a>
    <a href="#b">b</a>
    Set hash:
    <button onclick="location.hash='c'">c</button>
    <button onclick="location.hash='d'">d</button>
    Pushstate:
    <button onclick="history.pushState('e', null)">e</button>
    <button onclick="history.pushState('e', null)">f</button>
    History.length:
    <button onclick="console.log(history.length)">check</button>
</p>
<script>
    let n = 0;

    window.onpopstate = e => {
        console.debug(++n, e);
    }
    window.onhashchange = e => {
        console.debug(++n, e);
    }

</script>

<p>Click around, and observe:</p>
<ol>
    <li>history.length doesn't increase unless the hash actually changes</li>
    <li>history.length always increases on pushstate</li>
    <li>history.length doesn't decreaase with the back button</li>
    <li>history.length doesn't increase with the forward button</li>
    <li>history.length <b>does</b> decrease with the back-button and a new state</li>
    <li>window.onpopstate is called by the back-button and the forward button</li>
    <li>window.onpopstate is called when we change the hash</li>
    <li>window.onpopstate is <b>not</b> called when we call pushState</li>
</ol>

<p>
    onpopstate is poorly named because it implies that history is changing. but it can mean
    we're moving around the timeline, or it could mean we're adding a new state (with an anchor link).
    And by default it doesn't record pushState(). So, what we need is a) a reliable way to detect when
    window.history.length changes, and b) detect when the user moves within this history using forward and back.
    We can do this by a) not calling pushState directly, and b) factoring-out anchor-triggered popstateevents.
    We can detect anchor-caused popstateevents by checking the event <code>state</code>, which is null. We
    don't call pushState directly, instead using a proxy function. Not sure how to detect which direction
    we are moving!
