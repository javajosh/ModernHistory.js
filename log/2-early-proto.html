<h1 id="history">The Back Button and Browser History</h1>

<p>What follows is an attempt to accurately model an <i>SPA timeline</i> using modern browser API. It is a
    continuation of <a href="history.html">history.html</a>. The user can interact with the browser in 4 ways
    to affect their timeline:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Click an anchor link: <a href="#a">a</a> - <a href="#b">b</a></li>
    <li>Call pushState: <button onclick="addState('c')">c</button></li>
    <li>Call pushState: <button onclick="addState('d')">d</button></li>
    <li>Click the back button: <button onclick="window.history.back()">←</button></li>
    <li>Click the forward button: <button onclick="window.history.forward()">→</button></li>
</ol>

<p>Rules:</p>
<ol>
    <li>If you never hit the back button, anchors and pushstate add one state the timeline.</li>
    <li>If you hit the back button, anchor and pushstate delete the remaining timeline and then add one item.</li>
    <li>If you hit the back button beyond the first state, you leave the page.</li>
    <li>If you hit the forward button beyond the last state, you leave the page.</li>
</ol>

<p>Complications:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Both the back button and the forward button trigger onpopstate</li>
    <li>Clicking a new anchor triggers onpopstate</li>
    <li>There is no way to detect pushState()</li>
</ol>

<p>There is no way to distinguish between forward, back, or an anchor click within onpopstate. There is
no way to detect pushState. This is remarkably bad API design.</p>

<p>The first thing we do is normalize anchor clicks and pushState calls so that they both go through a proxy function.
This allows us to associate a custom state object with anchor clicks, which usually have a null state object. The
downside is that a) we must remember to call this special function (called <code>addState()</code>) and b) we must
register a click handler at the top-level to intercept hash changes before they happen.</p>

<p>An important piece of data is to see how window.history.length changes over time. If it increases
we know that a new state was added. If it decreases, we know a new state was added in the past. If it
stays the same, then we have moved within the timeline. If we've moved in the timeline, we can determine
forward or backward motion by comparing the current state with both the previous and next states in the timeline.</p>

<p>To simplify, normalize anchor clicks through pushState by using a click handler.</p>

<h3>Beyond the protoype</h3>
<p>This prototype is not ready to be used with real code, particularly because it pollutes the namespace. The plan is to
encapsulate it into a singleton object called "TimeLine" in a "timeline.js" file. The user would have to call TimeLine.start()
for it to take effect. It would sit and observe, and so emit events via a callback. It would also expose methods for moving
around, and moving to a specific state in the timeline.</p>

    window.onpopstate = e => {
